# Markdown Preview App

A simple React application created for freeCodeCamp certification.

This app lets user enter and edit plain text using markdown and get a live preview of the parsed result.

## Tech Stack

- Clear React (create-react-app).
- Redux-Toolkit.
- Bootstrap.
- Marked library for Markdown parsing.

Obviously, Redux-Toolkit wasn't required for a project of such scale. However, I used it anyway for practice.
